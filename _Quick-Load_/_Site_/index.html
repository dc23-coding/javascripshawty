      <strong>Music That Tells A Story</strong>

      <br />
      <div style="margin-top: 25px"></div>

      Cleshay Heru: A lyrically supreme Hip Hop Artist. I began making
      professional recordings around the 2000's, with the release of my first
      critically acclaimed work with Platinum Set, who later became known as the
      Heavy Hustlers. I have overcome countless obstacles on the way up, and
      continue to work hard each and every day to keep the musical journey
      moving forward. During those times, I went to college and was able to
      obtain knowledge in the Financial Markets. This led to a position with one
      of the top payroll companies in the United States as an Account Manager.
      Now, The objective is to bring that knowledge to a community of
      like-minded people, where we can join together to become an Economic Power
      as a Financial Group. I ask the family to support. We look to take the
      profits from sales to generate programs that we are all able to benefit
      from, such as a Private Equity Group. One that would not have a director
      or a fiduciary person in control of the funds. We will learn to use the
      blockchain, we we can peer to peer manage and grow our wealth together. I
      will be posting all videos on the website to keep everyone up to date on
      the current affairs. Please sign up and become a member to see exclusive
      video's and hear music that is not in main stream. I encourage you to also
      support on the mainstreams as well. Blessings
    </p>
